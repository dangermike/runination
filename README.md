# Runination (roon-in-ation)

A random string generator that works with unicode ranges

## What is it

There is a lot of content on StackOverflow and the like explaining how to quickly generate random strings. These almost all start with a string to hold the set of characters available. This works well for cases where single-byte utf-8 strings (read: ASCII-7) are used. When multi-byte characters appear, it turns to a big mess. Not only that, the set of characters is pretty staggering -- the number of characters in the [GraphicRanges](https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsGraphic) range is ~146,000. Having that as a constant in a file seems kind of silly.

Runination, as you might guess from the name, is [rune](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#rune)-based. By taking in a slice of [RangeTable](https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#RangeTable)s, it is not necessary to define all of the characters in a constant a the start.

This whole package is ridiculous overkill and was build purely for fun. Going this deep on a problem like this is really not necessary.

## CharSource

A [CharSource](source/source.go) is what translates the [RangeTable](https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#RangeTable)s into runes. A RangeTable defines how to walk the set of valid codepoints, which you can imagine doing two ways: One could walk them as soon as you get them, storing all of the runes encountered in a slice. Alternatively, you could navigate to the nth codepoint on-demand. The first method is faster once constructed, but can use a lot of memory. The second method has a faster start-up time, but uses no additional memory. These two methods are implemented as [CharSourceFlat](source/flatsource/flat.go) and [CharSourceRanged](source/rangedsource/ranged.go).

As expected, the flat source has a longer creation time in all but the smallest of cases and uses a lot more memory:

However, it also a lot faster. Flat is O(1), whereas ranged is O(log2 n) + O(m) where n is the number of ranges and m is the average size of each range.

Even just in terms of time, the choice isn't clear. As an example, if you are using the whole GraphicRanges set, you have the following functions:

```plain
flat = 2.635n + 147511
ranged = 29.71n + 7750
```

Which means the break-even point is at 5,162 characters, This is ignoring the fact that Flat uses 16x more memory than Ranged. On the other hand, for the `ASCII_hex_digit` set, Flat is faster and uses less memory before you even start!

## Getting random strings

Now that we have a source for random characters, we need to put them into strings. Most of the tricks one might use for fixed-byte characters (e.g. masking) just aren't available in variable-width characters. The only choice available is [strings.Builder](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Builder). There is one last trick we can use: the Builder, like slice and lots of other vector-like structures, grows when it runs out of space. If we can give it a good guess on the target size, we can avoid extra allocations. With fixed-width characters, that's as easy as multiplying the number of characters by the byte width. With variable-width characters, a guess is the best we can do. The `RandomGenerator` inspects the `CharSource` on start-up, measuring characters from the target set. If the total set of characters is less than 1,000, it just reads them all (less than 20Âµs on my laptop). If it is larger, 500 characters are randomly sampled. The result, which you can see in the benchmarks below, is that we average only one allocation per cycle. Without this optimization, only calling `Builder.Grow` with the length of the string, we averaged 3-4 allocations when using the largest strings and the GraphicRanges character set.

## Credits

This was a silly weekend project, but I was inspired to use the unicode RangeTables by [chrismcguire/gobberish](https://github.com/chrismcguire/gobberish). Runination doesn't add any functionality beyond what's in `gobberish`, but it is a lot faster. I don't know why one might care, but it is.
